Subject: IB/cma: Print warning on different inner and header P_Keys
Reply-To: joseph.salisbury@microsoft.com

Commit 4c21b5bcef73 ("IB/cma: Add net_dev and private data checks to RDMA
CM") added checks for incoming RDMA CM requests that they can be matched to
a netdev based on the P_Key in the BTH of the request. This behavior was
reverted in commit ab3964ad2acf ("IB/cma: Use inner P_Key to determine
netdev"), since the mlx5 and ipath drivers didn't send the correct value
in the BTH P_Key.

Since the ipath driver was removed, and the mlx5 driver can now send GSI
packets on different P_Keys, we could revert the patch to let the rdma_cm
module look on the BTH P_Key when deciding to what netdev a packet belongs.
However, that still breaks compatibility with the older drivers.

Change the behavior to print a warning when receiving a request that has a
different BTH P_Key and inner payload P_Key. In the future, after users
have seen the warnings and upgraded their setups, remove the warning and
block these requests.
