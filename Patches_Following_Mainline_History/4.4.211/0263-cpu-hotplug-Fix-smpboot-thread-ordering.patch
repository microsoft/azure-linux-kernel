Subject: cpu/hotplug: Fix smpboot thread ordering
Reply-To: joseph.salisbury@microsoft.com

Commit 931ef163309e moved the smpboot thread park/unpark invocation to the
state machine. The move of the unpark invocation was premature as it depends
on work in progress patches.

As a result cpu down can fail, because rcu synchronization in takedown_cpu()
eventually requires a functional softirq thread. I never encountered the
problem in testing, but 0day testing managed to provide a reliable reproducer.

Remove the smpboot_threads_park() call from the state machine for now and put
it back into the original place after the rcu synchronization.

I'm embarrassed as I knew about the dependency and still managed to get it
wrong. Hotplug induced brain melt seems to be the only sensible explanation
for that.
