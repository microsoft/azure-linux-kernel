Subject: PCI: hv: Use bytes 4 and 5 from instance ID as the PCI domain numbers
Reply-To: joseph.salisbury@microsoft.com

As recommended by Azure host team, the bytes 4, 5 have more uniqueness
(info entropy) than bytes 8, 9 so use them as the PCI domain numbers.

On older hosts, bytes 4, 5 can also be used -- no backward compatibility
issues are introduced and the chance of collision is greatly reduced.

In the rare cases of collision, the driver code detects and finds
another number that is not in use.
