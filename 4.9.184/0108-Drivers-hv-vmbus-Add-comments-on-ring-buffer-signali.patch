Subject: Drivers: hv: vmbus: Add comments on ring buffer signaling
Reply-To: joseph.salisbury@microsoft.com

Add comments describing intricacies of Hyper-V ring buffer
signaling code.  This information is not in Hyper-V public
documents, so include here to capture the knowledge for
future coders.

There are no code changes in this commit.
